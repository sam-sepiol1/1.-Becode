Type of challenge: **learning**  
Team challenge: **solo**

# Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

- understand the concept of variables

- be able to declare variables

- be able to assign value to variables

# The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of
[variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)),
complete the exercises down below after you’ve read the explanations.

A variable is like a box holding a value, it can be called upon whenever
needed and changed after assignment (except for *constant*). It also has
a type which defines the kinds of data you can store inside.

- [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(computer_programming)):
  store a value of any types that cannot change

- [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer): store integers

- [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic):
  store real numbers (ex: 3.14159)

- [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)):
  store one character

- [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type): store
  either *true* or *false*

- [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)):
  store a sequence of character

- [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type): store an array
  of values

Programming languages usually have some predefined functions such as
**output** and **input** allowing the code to print something to the
screen or ask for a user input.

Furthermore, you should also research
[operators](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Operators) and how
to do operation within your code.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Example**

</div>

    // This algorithm will output "Hi my name is John Doe and I am 42."
    constant NAME = "John Doe"
    integer age

    input("What's your age?",$age)
    output("Hi my name is $NAME and I am $age.")

    // This algorithm will output "10".
    integer nbr = 5
    output($nbr * 2)

## Exercises

- write your algorithm on paper

- detail each and every step

- indicates the types of used variables

- One good, try to write some code!

### I - calculate

Write an algorithm which calculates:

- the **sum** of two chosen number

- the **division** of two chosen number

- the [**modulo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) of
  two inputed numbers

### II - concatenate sentence

Write an algorithm which
[**concatenates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) two
phrases together.

### III - VAT

Write an algorithm which receives a **price without VAT** and returns
the **price with VAT** with a **rate of 21%**.

### IV - surface of a circle

Write an algorithm which receives the **radius of a circle** and
calculate its **surface**.

### V - conversion of time to seconds

Write an algorithm which receives the **time of day** in three different
numbers, the hour, the minutes and the seconds and returns the **number
of seconds** since midnight.

# Congrats

Variables, variables everywhere, they will soon become your best friend
or maybe your worst enemy, either way you’re gonna need them.
