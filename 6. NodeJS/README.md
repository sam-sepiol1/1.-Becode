- Repository: `learning-node`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `4-5 days`
- Deployment strategy: `Github pages | Netlify | Vercel | railway | render`
- Team challenge : `solo`

> While Javascript on the frontend is.. well.. a lot, did you know that we can also write our backend with Javascript?

## What is node?
In one sentence: `Node is a Javascript runtime or environment.`

But what does that mean?

Well let me get this straight first, Node is **NOT** a framework or library, it is a **runtime** written in the Javascript language. This allows us to **run Javascript on our machine** directly instead of having to use a browser as we did in frontend applications.

> So in conclusion, Node is a javascript runtime that allows us to run javascript on a server. 

## What do we use Node for?
Mostly for ...
 - REST API's
 - Real Time Services (chat apps, live changes or updates)
 - CRUD Apps (Blogs, E-shops, Social platforms)

> Node can be used for pretty much anything that is not CPU intensive.

## Learning Objectives

We will embark on a journey to learn how to **use package managers** and the basics on how to run a **node service** or **node runtime** on our machine, then as a RESTfull API and finally with a framework.

### Files/folders in node
Remember our Terminal exercise? Where we had so much fun discovering how to navigate, create or update local files or folders in your device? Well, now we are going to learn how to **handle** those **files/folders** with the help of some libraries and Javascript methods using NodeJs.

### Requests and responses
After having worked on the basics of handling files and folders in node, it is time... time to learn **how to handle requests as a server**.

### Finally, a framework!
Now, this was a lot.. really, all those requests, functions, files or folders.. if only there was a more simple way to do all of this.. Wait? what? there is a way? You are telling me that we can **use a framework (Express.js)** to simplify all of what we have seen? Great!
