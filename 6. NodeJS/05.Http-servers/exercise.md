# Everything together!

In the previous exercise, we have created a file structure. now it is time to use that file structure for our responses.

## Goals
By using our `path` and `fs` modules, create requests in our `http server` for every folder that we have in our project + the root. Each of those will respond by sending the html file back that matches to the url.

### Tips:
- for now, move your css content into your html as *inline styling* by using the `<style></style>` elements in your `<head></head>`.
- have a simple html structure: a title for each page is enough.

## Good luck!
